# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We generally only fully support the latest version of TurboMC. In the transition period during larger Minecraft updates, we may still backport important fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For any issues that are NOT duplication bugs, server/client crashes, or otherwise serious exploits, please open an issue
through the [Issues tab](https://github.com/janxhg/TurboMC/issues).

For critical exploits affecting the upstream Paper codebase, please [join the PaperMC Discord](https://discord.gg/papermc) and see the `#paper-exploit-report` channel.
For exploits specific to TurboMC features (SIMD/LZ4), please report them in our GitHub Issues.
