# Paper Changelog

## v1.0.0 - LZ4 Compression Support

### Summary
Added native LZ4 compression support to the server networking pipeline to handle connections from the optimized Velocity proxy. This reduces CPU overhead compared to standard Zlib compression.

### Technical Details
- **Network Pipeline**: Integrated LZ4 encoder (`Lz4PacketEncoder`) and decoder (`Lz4PacketDecoder`) into the Netty pipeline.
- **Connection Handshake**: Modified packet handling to recognize LZ4 compression signals from the proxy.
- **Compatibility**: Retains full support for standard Zlib compression for vanilla clients or other proxies.

### Configuration
Requires `paper-global.yml` settings:
```yaml
proxies:
  velocity:
    enabled: true
    # secret must match proxy
```
